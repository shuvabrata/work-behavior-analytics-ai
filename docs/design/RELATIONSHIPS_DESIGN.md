# Relationships Design: Single-Edge Same-Name Relationships (Undirected Queries)

## Overview

This document explains the design decision to implement **single-edge relationships with undirected querying** for same-name relationships in the Neo4j graph database. This approach simplifies AI-powered query generation while avoiding duplicate relationship storage.

## Rationale

### The Problem
When users ask natural language questions, they often express relationships in both directions without thinking about the underlying graph structure:

- "Show me all issues assigned to Alice" (Person ← Issue traversal)
- "Show me Alice's assigned issues" (Person → Issue traversal)
- "What repositories does the Platform Team collaborate on?" (Team → Repository)
- "Who are the collaborators on backend-api?" (Repository → Team/Person)

### Traditional Approach Limitation
In a traditional unidirectional graph model, queries would need to:
1. Know the exact direction of the relationship
2. Use reverse traversal patterns (matching in opposite direction)
3. Complicate query generation logic for AI systems

### Our Solution: Same Name, Stored Once + Undirected Queries
By creating **a single relationship and querying it without direction**, we achieve:
1. **Minimal cognitive load** - AI only needs to learn ONE relationship name, not two
2. **Simplified query patterns** - queries work naturally in either direction
3. **No semantic confusion** - the relationship means the same thing regardless of direction
4. **Lower storage/write cost** - only one edge is stored, not two

Example with same-name undirected relationships:
```cypher
// Both queries use the same relationship name
MATCH (issue:Issue)-[:ASSIGNED_TO]-(person:Person {name: "Alice"})
RETURN issue

MATCH (person:Person {name: "Alice"})-[:ASSIGNED_TO]-(issue:Issue)
RETURN issue
```

## Relationship Categories

### Category 1: Same Name, Stored Once (Undirected Traversal)

These relationships use the **exact same name** and are **stored once** because they represent symmetric or naturally bidirectional concepts. Query them with undirected patterns (`-[:REL]-`).

| Relationship Name | Usage | Example |
|------------------|-------|---------|
| `ASSIGNED_TO` | Work assignment | Issue ↔ Person, Epic ↔ Person, Initiative ↔ Person |
| `MEMBER_OF` | Team membership | Person ↔ Team |
| `TEAM` | Team ownership | Epic ↔ Team, Issue ↔ Team |
| `COLLABORATOR` | Repository access | Person/Team ↔ Repository |
| `REPORTED_BY` | Issue/work reporting | Issue/Initiative ↔ Person |
| `MAPS_TO` | Identity mapping | IdentityMapping ↔ Person |
| `RELATES_TO` | Related issues | Issue ↔ Issue (inherently symmetric) |
| `MENTIONS` | @-mention in content | Issue/Epic/Initiative/Page ↔ Person |

### Category 2: Different Names for Directionality (Hierarchical Relationships)

These relationships maintain different names because they represent clear hierarchical or directional concepts:

| Forward Relationship | Reverse Relationship | Description |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `PART_OF` | `CONTAINS` | Hierarchical containment |
| `REPORTS_TO` | `MANAGES` | Management hierarchy |
| `MANAGES` (Person→Team) | `MANAGED_BY` (Team→Person) | Team management |
| `BLOCKS` | `BLOCKED_BY` | Issue blocking |
| `DEPENDS_ON` | `DEPENDENCY_OF` | Issue dependencies |
| `IN_SPRINT` | `CONTAINS` | Sprint containment |
| `MODIFIES` | `MODIFIED_BY` | File modifications |
| `REFERENCES` | `REFERENCED_BY` | Issue references |
| `INCLUDES` | `INCLUDED_IN` | PR commits |
| `TARGETS` | `TARGETED_BY` | PR base branch |
| `CREATED_BY` | `CREATED` | Commit or PullRequest creation |
| `REVIEWED_BY` | `REVIEWED` | PR reviews |
| `REQUESTED_REVIEWER` | `REVIEW_REQUESTED_BY` | Review requests |
| `MERGED_BY` | `MERGED` | PR merge action |

### Category 3: Unidirectional Relationships

These relationships exist in only one direction:

| Relationship Name | From → To | Description |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `LEADS` | Person → Project | Project leadership |
| `FROM` | PullRequest → Branch | PR head branch (source) |
| `COMMENTED_ON` | Person → Entity | Comment authored on a work item / page (directed) |
| `REACTED_TO` | Person → Entity | Reaction (emoji) applied to a work item / page (directed) |

## Query Examples

### Example 1: Finding Assigned Work (Same Relationship, Undirected)

**Natural language**: "What is Alice working on?"

```cypher
// Works naturally - undirected traversal from Person to work items
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alice"})-[:ASSIGNED_TO]-(work)
WHERE work:Issue OR work:Epic OR work:Initiative
RETURN work
```

**Natural language**: "Who is assigned to PLAT-123?"

```cypher
// Also works naturally - undirected traversal from Issue to Person
MATCH (i:Issue {key: "PLAT-123"})-[:ASSIGNED_TO]-(person:Person)
RETURN person
```

### Example 2: Repository Collaboration

**Natural language**: "What repositories can Alice access?"

```cypher
// Undirected traversal between Person and Repository
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alice"})-[:COLLABORATOR]-(repo:Repository)
RETURN repo
```

**Natural language**: "Who has access to backend-api?"

```cypher
// Undirected traversal between Repository and Person/Team
MATCH (r:Repository {name: "backend-api"})-[:COLLABORATOR]-(collaborator)
RETURN collaborator
```

### Example 3: Code Authorship

**Natural language**: "What did Alice author?"

```cypher
// Person-centric: traverse the directed CREATED_BY edge in reverse
MATCH (p:Person {name: "Alice"})<-[:CREATED_BY]-(commit:Commit)
RETURN commit
```

**Natural language**: "Who authored commit abc123?"

```cypher
// Commit-centric: follow the directed CREATED_BY edge forward
MATCH (c:Commit {sha: "abc123"})-[:CREATED_BY]->(person:Person)
RETURN person
```

### Example 4: Hierarchical Queries (Different Names for Clarity)

**Natural language**: "What epics are in this initiative?"

```cypher
// Use CONTAINS for top-down traversal
MATCH (i:Initiative {key: "PLAT-1"})-[:CONTAINS]->(epic:Epic)
RETURN epic
```

**Natural language**: "What initiative does this epic belong to?"

```cypher
// Use PART_OF for bottom-up traversal
MATCH (e:Epic {key: "PLAT-100"})-[:PART_OF]->(initiative:Initiative)
RETURN initiative
```

### Example 5: Unidirectional Relationships

**Natural language**: "Who leads the Platform project?"

```cypher
// LEADS is unidirectional - only Person -> Project
MATCH (person:Person)-[:LEADS]->(project:Project {key: "PLAT"})
RETURN person
```

**Natural language**: "What is the source branch for this PR?"

```cypher
// FROM is unidirectional - only PullRequest -> Branch (head)
MATCH (pr:PullRequest {number: 42})-[:FROM]->(branch:Branch)
RETURN branch
```

## AI Query Generation Benefits

When using Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert natural language to Cypher:

1. **Reduced vocabulary** - The model only needs to learn 36 relationship names instead of 70+
2. **Semantic clarity** - Same-name undirected relationships (8 types) work in either direction
3. **Higher accuracy** - Strategic use of shared names reduces mistakes in relationship selection
4. **Simpler prompts** - Documentation and examples are more concise
5. **Better generalization** - For symmetric concepts, direction doesn't matter

### Comparison: Traditional vs Same-Name Approach

**Traditional Unidirectional Approach (70+ names)**:
- AI must learn: `ASSIGNED_TO`, `HAS_ASSIGNEE`, `CREATED_BY`, `CREATED`, `REVIEWED_BY`, `HAS_REVIEWER`, etc.
- AI must decide: "Does user want ASSIGNED_TO or HAS_ASSIGNEE?"
- Risk: Using wrong direction requires fallback query logic or query fails

**Our Undirected Same-Name Approach (36 names)**:
- AI must learn: Fewer total names due to strategic use of same-name undirected relationships
- For symmetric relationships: AI uses same name, direction doesn't matter
- For hierarchical/directional: AI uses semantic names (PART_OF vs CONTAINS, BLOCKS vs BLOCKED_BY)
- Risk: Minimal - most common queries work naturally in either direction

## Implementation Notes

- Same-name undirected relationships are created once during data loading
- Directional pairs are still created in both directions
- Query performance is improved for common access patterns
- Relationship properties (if any) are stored once for undirected relationships

### Snapshot Semantics for Interaction Edges

`COMMENTED_ON` and `REACTED_TO` use **snapshot semantics**: the producer emits the
authoritative full set of interactions per entity on each sync, and the consumer
replaces the edges on re-processing rather than accumulating duplicates. The edge
carries aggregated properties instead of one edge per interaction:

| Property | Type | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| `count` | int | Number of comments/reactions aggregated into this edge |
| `first_interaction_at` | timestamp | Earliest interaction time |
| `last_interaction_at` | timestamp | Latest interaction time |

This is implemented via `replace_snapshot_interaction_relationships()` in
`src/connectors/neo4j_db/models.py`, applied uniformly to Issues, PullRequests,
Epics, and Initiatives. See `docs/design/consumer-development-guide.md`.

## Maintenance

When adding new relationship types:

1. **Determine relationship category**: 
   - Same-name undirected (symmetric concepts like ASSIGNED_TO)
   - Different-name bidirectional (directional but traversable both ways like PART_OF/CONTAINS)
   - Unidirectional (one-way only like LEADS or FROM)
2. **Choose names carefully**: For directional pairs, select natural names for each direction
3. **Update relationship directionality definitions**: Add to `UNDIRECTED_RELATIONSHIPS` or `DIRECTIONAL_RELATIONSHIPS` in `db/models.py`
4. **Update load scripts**: Create relationships according to category
5. **Document here**: Add to the appropriate category in this document
6. **Update tests**: Ensure validation queries work as expected
7. **Update catalog path queries**: If the new relationship represents work collaboration (not membership, hierarchy, or containment), add its type to the relationship-type whitelist in `queries_catalog/person_to_person/shortest_paths_through_work_artifacts.yaml`. If it is GitHub-specific, also add it to `queries_catalog/person_to_person/shortest_paths_through_code.yaml`. These queries traverse an explicit relationship whitelist at path-expansion time, so newly introduced collaboration edges are invisible to them until added.

## Performance Considerations

- **Storage**: Undirected relationships store a single edge; directional pairs still store two
- **Write performance**: Faster for undirected types (1x creation), unchanged for directional pairs
- **Read performance**: Undirected queries remain fast for reverse traversal
- **Index usage**: Both directions benefit from node property indexes

## Conclusion

Same-name undirected relationships are essential for:
- Natural language query generation
- AI-powered graph analytics
- Improved developer experience
- Better query performance

The remaining overhead during data loading for directional pairs is outweighed by the benefits in query flexibility and performance.
