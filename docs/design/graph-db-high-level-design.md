# Project Graph Database - High Level Design

**Version**: 0.1  
**Last Updated**: January 4, 2026  
**Status**: Design Phase

---

## 1. Vision & Problem Statement

### 1.1 Vision
Build a graph-based analytics platform that surfaces hidden data points from enterprise systems (GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Org Structure, Cloud Infrastructure) to enable data-driven decision making for technical leaders, moving beyond gut-feel and experience.

### 1.2 Core Problem
Technical leaders today lack visibility into:
- Alignment between business plans and actual progress
- Resource allocation efficiency (are top talents on critical projects?)
- Impact of changing priorities
- Team efficiency metrics
- People manager focus areas
- Skill set gaps
- Hotspots and abnormal patterns across artifacts

### 1.3 Key Principles
1. **Comprehensive Capture**: Everything matters - more variables = more analytical potential
2. **Historical Context**: Time-series data essential for trend analysis and pattern detection
3. **Relationship-First**: Connections between entities reveal hidden insights
4. **Incremental Implementation**: Complete model definition, phased implementation
5. **Hotspot Detection**: Unexpected changes indicate risk or high-value areas

---

## 2. Use Cases & Analytics Goals

### 2.1 Strategic Questions (To Be Answered)

#### Resource & Talent Alignment
- Are top performers working on critical projects?
- Which teams/people are bottlenecks?
- Skill coverage: who can work on what?
- Skill gaps: what capabilities are missing?

#### Progress & Alignment
- Does business plan match ground reality?
- Which epics/initiatives are blocked or at risk?
- Dependency chains: what's the critical path?

#### Change & Efficiency
- How do teams adapt to changing priorities?
- What's the true cost of context switching?
- Team velocity trends over time
- Code ownership patterns and fragmentation

#### Risk & Quality
- Which components are hotspots? (high churn, many authors, frequent bugs)
- Cross-team dependencies creating risk?
- Where are people managers spending time? (meetings, reviews, incidents)

### 2.2 Example Analytical Queries
```cypher
// Find critical projects with junior talent assigned
MATCH (proj:Project)-[:HAS_EPIC]->(epic:Epic)-[:HAS_ISSUE]->(issue:Issue)
MATCH (issue)-[:ASSIGNED_TO]-(person:Person)
WHERE proj.priority = 'Critical' AND person.seniority = 'Junior'
RETURN proj, count(issue) as junior_assigned_count

// Identify code hotspots: high churn + many authors + bug fixes
MATCH (file:File)-[:HAS_COMMIT]->(commit:Commit)
MATCH (commit)-[:CREATED_BY]->(author:Person)
MATCH (commit)-[:REFERENCES]->(issue:Issue {type: 'Bug'})
WHERE commit.timestamp > date('2025-10-01')
RETURN file.path, 
       count(DISTINCT commit) as commit_count,
       count(DISTINCT author) as author_count,
       count(DISTINCT issue) as bug_count
ORDER BY commit_count DESC, author_count DESC
```

### 3.2 Temporal Model & History

**Design Decision**: How to handle time-series data?

#### Option A: Event Sourcing
- Store every state change as an event node
- Pros: Complete audit trail, point-in-time queries
- Cons: Large graph, complex queries

#### Option B: Temporal Properties
- Add versioned properties (status_history, assignee_history)
- Pros: Simpler model
- Cons: Limited query capability

#### Option C: Snapshot Nodes
- Create periodic snapshot nodes for key entities
- Pros: Balance between detail and complexity
- Cons: Lossy between snapshots

**Recommendation**: Hybrid approach
- Use temporal properties for lightweight tracking
- Create Event nodes for significant changes
- Periodic snapshots for complex entities

**Event Node** (for significant changes)
TODO: Create class definition in [db/models.py](../db/models.py)

Relationships:
  - HAPPENED_TO → (any node)
  - PERFORMED_BY → Person
  - PREVIOUS_EVENT → Event (linked list)

## 4. Design Decisions

### 4.1 Identity Resolution
**Question**: How to unify identities across systems?
- GitHub user != Jira user != Confluence user
- Need mapping table or heuristics (email matching?)

**Solution**: Master Identity Table with Hybrid Matching

The application will maintain a master identity table that merges IDs from different systems into a single row for each unique identity.

**Three-Phase Approach**:

1. **Automatic Email Matching**
   - Primary strategy: Match users across systems by email address
   - Email is the canonical identifier when available
   - Handles ~80-90% of cases automatically

2. **Fuzzy Matching with Suggestions**
   - For unmatched identities, apply fuzzy matching on:
     - Name similarity (Levenshtein distance)
     - Username patterns (e.g., john.smith vs jsmith)
     - Domain context (same organization)
   - Present suggestions to end users for review
   - Confidence score threshold (e.g., >0.85 for auto-merge, 0.6-0.85 for suggestions)

3. **Manual Mapping**
   - Admin interface for manual identity linking
   - Override automatic matches if incorrect
   - Handle edge cases (contractors, name changes, duplicate accounts)
   - Audit trail for manual changes

**Implementation Details**:

```yaml
IdentityMapping Node:
  Properties:
    - master_id: string (canonical person ID)
    - system: string (github/jira/confluence/aws)
    - external_id: string (ID in external system)
    - external_username: string
    - external_email: string
    - match_method: string (email/manual/fuzzy)
    - match_confidence: float (0.0-1.0)
    - verified: boolean
    - created_at: timestamp
    - verified_at: timestamp
    - verified_by: string (admin user)
  
  Relationships:
    - MAPS_TO ↔ Person (undirected, master identity)
```

**Workflow**:
1. Data ingestion extracts user info from each system
2. Identity resolver attempts email matching first
3. Unmatched identities go through fuzzy matching
4. High-confidence matches (>0.85) auto-link with review flag
5. Medium-confidence matches (0.6-0.85) queued for user approval
6. Low-confidence matches (<0.6) remain unlinked until manual review
7. Periodic review dashboard shows pending matches

**Edge Cases**:
- **No email available**: Use fuzzy matching + manual fallback
- **Multiple emails**: Link all emails to same master identity
- **Name changes**: Keep history, link to same master_id
- **Contractors/External**: Mark as external in Person.type
- **Bots/Service accounts**: Separate handling, exclude from analytics

**Database Schema** (supporting table):
```sql
CREATE TABLE identity_mappings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  master_person_id UUID NOT NULL,
  system VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  external_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  external_username VARCHAR(255),
  external_email VARCHAR(255),
  match_method VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- email, manual, fuzzy
  match_confidence DECIMAL(3,2),
  verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  verified_at TIMESTAMP,
  verified_by VARCHAR(255),
  UNIQUE(system, external_id)
);
```

### 4.2 Data Freshness
**Question**: Real-time vs batch updates?
- Real-time: Webhooks from GitHub/Jira
- Batch: Periodic polling (easier to start)

**Decision**: Batch Update Approach

**Rationale**: 
In real-life scenarios, project updates and changes are not sufficiently meaningful for decision-making when captured in real-time. Leadership decisions on resource allocation, project priorities, and team adjustments are typically made on a weekly cadence during planning meetings and sprint reviews. Even a daily data refresh provides more than adequate freshness for these decision-making processes.

**Key Considerations**:
- **Decision Frequency**: Strategic and tactical decisions happen weekly (sprint planning, status reviews)
- **Data Stability**: Daily batch ensures consistent snapshots without mid-day fluctuations
- **System Simplicity**: Avoids complexity of webhook infrastructure, event queues, and real-time processing
- **API Rate Limits**: Batch updates are more predictable and easier to manage within API quotas
- **Data Quality**: Batch processing allows for validation and enrichment before graph updates
- **Cost Efficiency**: Lower infrastructure costs compared to real-time event processing

**Implementation**:
- **Frequency**: Daily batch runs (e.g., 2 AM local time)
- **Incremental Updates**: Only fetch changes since last sync (using timestamps/cursors)
- **Prioritization**: 
  - Critical systems (GitHub, Jira): Daily
  - Secondary systems (Confluence, AWS): Every 2-3 days initially
- **Manual Refresh**: On-demand refresh capability for urgent needs
- **Monitoring**: Track sync status, data lag, and failure alerts

**Future Enhancement**:
If real-time updates become necessary (e.g., incident response dashboards), webhooks can be added selectively for high-priority event types without re-architecting the entire system.

**Batch Schedule**:
```yaml
Daily (2:00 AM):
  - GitHub: commits, PRs, branches (last 24 hours)
  - Jira: issue updates, sprint changes (last 24 hours)
  - Person: new/updated users across all systems

Every 3 Days:
  - GitHub: repository metadata, team memberships
  - Jira: project/board configurations
  
Weekly:
  - Confluence: page updates, space changes
  - AWS: infrastructure changes
  - Full reconciliation and cleanup
```

### 4.3 Graph Database Selection
**Question**: Which graph database?
- Neo4j: Industry standard, great for analytics
- Amazon Neptune: If AWS-native desired
- ArangoDB: Multi-model flexibility

**Decision**: Neo4j

**Rationale**:
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Industry-standard graph database with 15+ years of development
- **Cypher Query Language**: Intuitive, SQL-like query language ideal for graph traversals
- **Analytics Capabilities**: Native support for graph algorithms (PageRank, community detection, shortest path)
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent documentation, large community, extensive libraries
- **Tooling**: Built-in visualization (Neo4j Browser), monitoring, and management tools
- **Python Integration**: Strong support via py2neo and official neo4j-driver
- **Scale**: Proven to handle billions of nodes and relationships
- **Flexibility**: Available as Community Edition (free) or Enterprise for production

**Deployment Options**:
- **Development**: Neo4j Community Edition (Docker container)
- **Production**: Neo4j AuraDB (managed cloud) or self-hosted Enterprise
- **Estimated Scale**: Mid-tier instance sufficient for typical enterprise (1M+ nodes)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Amazon Neptune: AWS-native but less mature tooling, Gremlin/SPARQL less intuitive than Cypher
- ArangoDB: Multi-model interesting but adds complexity, smaller community

### 4.4 Schema Evolution
**Question**: How to handle schema changes?
- Nodes/relationships will evolve
- Need migration strategy
- **TODO**: Document versioning approach

### 4.5 Data Volume Estimation
**Question**: What scale are we targeting?
- Typical enterprise: 100s of repos, 1000s of people, 100Ks of commits
- Need to estimate node/edge counts

**Target Organization Profile**:
- **Size**: Large organizations
- **Repositories**: 10-99 (average) to few thousands (max)
- **Employee Count**: ~500 (average) to few thousands (max)
- **Historical Data**: 5+ years of Confluence and Jira activity
- **Rationale**: New orgs don't need sophisticated analytics; mature orgs with history benefit most

**Estimated Graph Size (Average Organization)**:

**Nodes**:
```
People & Organization:
  - Person: 500
  - Team: 50
  - Organization/Department: 10
  Total: 560

Source Control (50 repos, 5 years):
  - Repository: 50
  - Branch: 200 (4 per repo avg)
  - Commit: 250,000 (100 commits/repo/year)
  - PullRequest: 25,000 (10 PRs/repo/year)
  - File: 50,000 (1,000 files/repo avg)
  - Directory: 5,000
  Total: 330,250

Issue Tracking (5 years):
  - Project: 20
  - Board: 30
  - Epic: 500
  - Issue: 50,000 (10,000/year)
  - Sprint: 250 (52/year)
  Total: 50,800

Identity:
  - IdentityMapping: 2,500 (5 systems × 500 people)

Documentation (5 years):
  - Space: 30
  - Page: 10,000 (2,000/year)
  Total: 10,030

Grand Total Nodes: ~393,640
```

**Edges/Relationships**:
```
Estimated: 5-10× node count = 2-4 million edges

Key relationships:
  - Commit → Person (CREATED_BY, directed): 250K
  - Commit → File (MODIFIES): 1M (4 files per commit avg)
  - Issue ↔ Person (ASSIGNED_TO, undirected): 50K
  - Person ↔ Team (MEMBER_OF, undirected): 500
  - Issue → Commit (FIXED_IN): 100K
  - PullRequest → Commit (HAS_COMMIT): 150K
  - ... and many more
```

**Storage Estimates**:
- **Nodes**: ~400K × 1KB avg = 400 MB
- **Relationships**: ~3M × 500 bytes avg = 1.5 GB
- **Total Database Size**: ~5-10 GB (with indexes)
- **Neo4j Instance**: 8-16 GB RAM, 50 GB disk sufficient

**Large Organization (Maximum Scale)**:
- Repositories: 2,000
- Employees: 3,000
- Nodes: ~15M
- Edges: ~100M
- Database Size: ~200-300 GB
- Neo4j Instance: 64-128 GB RAM, 1 TB disk

**Scalability Considerations**:
- Neo4j Community Edition handles up to 34 billion nodes
- Average organization well within comfortable limits
- Even maximum scale manageable with Enterprise Edition
- Query performance depends on index design and query patterns
- Consider time-based partitioning for >10 year historical data

### 4.6 Privacy & Security
**Question**: What data should NOT be stored?
- Sensitive code content
- Personal information beyond work profile
- Private messages/comments?

**Current Approach**: Organization-Hosted Deployment Model

**Decision**: 
Privacy and security requirements will be addressed with finer details after achieving a successful product. For the initial phase, the deployment model simplifies many privacy concerns:

**Deployment Constraints**:
- **On-Premise/Org-Hosted Only**: Database remains within organization boundaries
- **No SaaS Model**: Deliberately avoiding multi-tenant SaaS to eliminate cross-organization data privacy complexities
- **Customer-Controlled**: Each organization manages their own infrastructure and data
- **Network Isolation**: Graph database accessible only within organization's network/VPN

**Implications**:
- **Data Sovereignty**: Organization controls where data lives (their cloud account or data center)
- **Compliance**: Organization's existing compliance policies apply (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)
- **Access Control**: Managed through organization's existing identity provider (SSO/SAML)
- **Data Retention**: Organization decides retention policies
- **Audit Logs**: Stored within organization's systems

**Basic Privacy Guidelines (Initial Phase)**:
- **Store**: Metadata, relationships, metrics, timestamps, public work artifacts
- **Store with caution**: Issue descriptions, PR comments, commit messages (useful for context)
- **Do NOT store**: 
  - Actual source code content (only file paths and metadata)
  - Personal contact info beyond work email
  - Private messages between individuals
  - Credentials, tokens, secrets
  - Sensitive business data in raw form

**Future Considerations**:
If SaaS model becomes necessary:
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive fields
- Detailed data classification and retention policies
- GDPR/CCPA compliance framework
- Right to deletion and data portability
- Security certifications (SOC2, ISO 27001)
- Multi-tenant isolation guarantees

**Current Priority**: Focus on value delivery; leverage customer's existing security infrastructure rather than building comprehensive data protection layer prematurely.

### 4.7 Deleted Entities
**Question**: How to handle deletions?
- Soft delete (is_deleted flag) vs hard delete
- Important for historical queries

**Decision**: Immutable Database with Snapshot-Based Model

**Approach**:
The database will be **immutable in nature** as we are collecting data snapshots over time. Entities are never truly deleted; instead, we track their lifecycle through snapshots.

**Rationale**:
- **Historical Analysis**: Essential for answering "what happened" questions
- **Trend Detection**: Compare states over time to identify patterns
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all changes
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Maintain records for required retention periods
- **Rollback Capability**: Restore previous states if needed
- **Analytics Accuracy**: Avoid skewing metrics by removing historical data

**Implementation**:

**Snapshot Properties** (added to relevant nodes):
```yaml
Common temporal properties:
  - first_seen_at: timestamp (when entity first appeared)
  - last_seen_at: timestamp (when entity last observed)
  - is_active: boolean (present in latest snapshot)
  - snapshot_date: date (which snapshot this data came from)
  - deleted_at: timestamp (when marked deleted in source system)
```

**Examples**:

1. **Deleted Repository**:
   - Repository node remains in graph
   - `is_active = false`
   - `deleted_at = 2025-12-15`
   - All historical commits, PRs, and relationships preserved

2. **Person Leaving Organization**:
   - Person node retained
   - `is_active = false`
   - `last_seen_at = 2025-11-30`
   - All historical contributions intact for analytics

3. **Closed Issue**:
   - Issue node remains
   - Status changes tracked via Event nodes or temporal properties
   - Can analyze time-to-resolution, who closed it, etc.

**Query Patterns**:
```cypher
// Only active entities (most common)
MATCH (p:Person {is_active: true})

// Historical snapshot at specific date
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.first_seen_at <= date('2025-06-01') 
  AND (p.last_seen_at >= date('2025-06-01') OR p.last_seen_at IS NULL)

// Analyze deleted/inactive entities
MATCH (r:Repository {is_active: false})
WHERE r.deleted_at > date('2025-01-01')
RETURN r.name, r.deleted_at
```

**Storage Optimization**:
- Periodic archival of very old snapshots (>3-5 years) to separate storage if needed
- Compression for historical data rarely accessed
- Retain aggregated metrics even if detailed data archived

**Benefits**:
- No data loss from accidental deletions
- Support "time travel" queries ("who was on this team 6 months ago?")
- Understand organizational changes over time
- Detect patterns in repository lifecycle, team churn, etc.

### 4.8 Computed Metrics
**Question**: Store metrics in graph or compute on-demand?
- Examples: code churn, velocity, centrality scores
- Pre-compute: Faster queries, staleness risk
- On-demand: Always fresh, slower

**Decision**: Hybrid Approach Based on Use Case

**Strategy**:
The approach depends on the specific metric and its usage patterns. Some metrics can be pre-computed during data ingestion, while others require scheduled analytics pipelines to compute periodically.

**Category 1: Pre-Computed Metrics (During Ingestion)**
Calculated as data arrives and stored as node properties:
```yaml
Examples:
  - Commit counts per person
  - File modification counts
  - PR review counts
  - Issue resolution times (when closed)
  - Lines added/deleted aggregates
  
Characteristics:
  - Simple aggregations
  - Derived from single data source
  - Frequently accessed in queries
  - Low computational cost
  - Stored as node properties
```

**Category 2: Scheduled Analytics Pipelines**
Computed by periodic batch jobs (daily/weekly):
```yaml
Examples:
  - Code hotspot scores (churn × authors × bugs)
  - Team velocity trends (requires multi-sprint history)
  - Graph centrality metrics (PageRank, betweenness)
  - Skill coverage analysis (person-project matching)
  - Dependency risk scores (cross-team coupling)
  - Knowledge silo detection (bus factor calculations)
  
Characteristics:
  - Complex graph algorithms
  - Require traversing large portions of graph
  - Updated less frequently (daily/weekly acceptable)
  - Computationally expensive
  - May create derived nodes or properties
```

**Category 3: On-Demand Computation**
Calculated at query time:
```yaml
Examples:
  - Specific date range analysis (custom timeframe)
  - Ad-hoc relationship traversals
  - Drill-down queries for specific entities
  - Real-time filters and aggregations
  
Characteristics:
  - User-specific queries
  - Variable parameters
  - Not reusable across users
  - Interactive response time acceptable (1-5s)
```

**Implementation Architecture**:

```yaml
Ingestion Pipeline:
  - Calculate simple metrics (counts, sums, averages)
  - Store as node properties
  - Update incrementally with each batch

Analytics Pipeline (Scheduled):
  - Runs daily at 3 AM (after data ingestion at 2 AM)
  - Computes complex metrics using Neo4j Graph Data Science library
  - Stores results as:
    - Node properties (scores, rankings)
    - Derived relationship properties (weights, strengths)
    - Separate metric nodes for time-series tracking
  - Parallelizable for large graphs

Query Layer:
  - Reads pre-computed metrics for dashboard views
  - Combines cached metrics with on-demand filters
  - Triggers background refresh if metrics stale
```

**Metric Storage Example**:
```cypher
// Pre-computed property
(file:File {
  path: "src/main.py",
  commit_count: 145,
  author_count: 8,
  last_hotspot_score: 0.82,
  score_computed_at: datetime('2026-01-04T03:00:00Z')
})

// Time-series metric node
(metric:Metric {
  entity_id: "file:src/main.py",
  metric_type: "hotspot_score",
  value: 0.82,
  computed_at: datetime('2026-01-04T03:00:00Z')
})
```

**Caching Strategy**:
- Dashboard queries use pre-computed metrics
- Cache TTL: 24 hours (refreshed nightly)
- Stale indicator if >48 hours old
- Manual refresh option for critical analysis

**Benefits**:
- Balance between performance and freshness
- Flexibility for different query patterns
- Optimize infrastructure costs
- Support both routine dashboards and ad-hoc analysis
