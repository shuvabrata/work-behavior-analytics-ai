# Layer 8: Pull Requests

## Overview
Layer 8 generates realistic pull request data including review workflows, approvals, and commit linkage. This is the final layer that completes the development workflow traceability from Jira to Git.

## Files in This Layer
- **generate_data.py**: Generates 100 pull requests with realistic metrics and relationships
- **load_to_neo4j.py**: Loads PR nodes and relationships into Neo4j database
- **README.md**: This documentation file
- **SUMMARY.md**: Implementation summary with statistics and validation results

## Dependencies
- **Layer 1**: People & Teams (for PR authors, reviewers, mergers)
- **Layer 6**: Branches (for TARGETS and FROM relationships)
- **Layer 7**: Commits (for INCLUDES relationship - merged PRs only)

## Generated Data

### Pull Requests (100 total)
- **Merged PRs**: 75-83 (75%)
- **Open PRs**: 10-15 (15%)
- **Closed PRs**: 7-10 (10%)

### Properties
Each PR includes:
- Basic info: id, number, title, description, state
- Timestamps: created_at, updated_at, merged_at, closed_at
- Metrics: commits_count, additions, deletions, changed_files
- Engagement: comments, review_comments
- Branch info: head_branch_name, base_branch_name
- Classification: labels, mergeable_state, draft

### Relationships (7 types, 1,033 total)

#### INCLUDES (PullRequest → Commit) - 384 relationships
- **Only for merged PRs** (constraint from Layer 7)
- Links PRs to commits that were merged to main branch
- Open/closed PRs have NO commit relationships (commits not on main yet/ever)
- Average 6.2 commits per merged PR

#### TARGETS (PullRequest → Branch) - 100 relationships
- Always points to default branch (main)
- Exists for ALL PRs (merged, open, closed)

#### FROM (PullRequest → Branch) - 100 relationships
- Points to source/head branch (feature branch)
- Exists for ALL PRs

#### CREATED_BY (PullRequest → Person) - 100 relationships
- PR author
- Exists for ALL PRs

#### REVIEWED_BY (PullRequest → Person) - 155 relationships
- People who submitted reviews
- Properties: `state` ("APPROVED", "CHANGES_REQUESTED", "COMMENTED")
- 90% of PRs have at least one reviewer
- 60% have 2+ reviewers

#### REQUESTED_REVIEWER (PullRequest → Person) - 211 relationships
- People who were asked to review
- Enables "ignored review request" analysis
- Some reviewers were requested but haven't reviewed yet (bottleneck detection)

#### MERGED_BY (PullRequest → Person) - 83 relationships
- Person who merged the PR
- Only exists for merged PRs
- Usually senior engineers or the PR author

## Usage

### Generate Data
```bash
cd simulation/layer8
python generate_data.py
```

Generates `../data/layer8_pull_requests.json` with:
- 100 pull request nodes
- 1,033 relationships across 7 types

### Load to Neo4j
```bash
python load_to_neo4j.py
```

The loader script will:
- Clear existing Layer 8 data
- Create constraints for PR uniqueness  
- Load 100 PR nodes
- Create 1,033 relationships
- Run 10 validation queries

## Data Distribution

### By Repository
- k8s-infrastructure: 20 PRs
- web-app: 25 PRs
- ios-app: 15 PRs
- gateway: 10 PRs
- user-service: 10 PRs
- order-service: 10 PRs
- service-mesh: 5 PRs
- streaming-pipeline: 5 PRs

### By Size
- Small (1-3 commits): 40%
- Medium (4-8 commits): 40%
- Large (9-20 commits): 20%

## Key Design Decisions

### Layer 7 Constraint
Since Layer 7 only tracks commits on the default branch (main), the `INCLUDES` relationship:
- ✅ Exists for **merged PRs** (commits are now on main)
- ❌ Does NOT exist for **open PRs** (commits still on feature branch)
- ❌ Does NOT exist for **closed PRs** (commits never merged)

This reflects reality: only merged code is tracked in production.

### Commit Metadata Preservation
Even without `INCLUDES` relationships, ALL PRs retain commit metadata as properties:
- commits_count
- additions
- deletions  
- changed_files

### Review Patterns
- 80% approval rate before merge
- Average review time: 1-3 days
- Cross-team reviews included for collaboration analysis

## Analytics Enabled

With Layer 8, you can now analyze:

1. **Code Review Effectiveness**
   - Who reviews the most?
   - Average time to review
   - Approval vs change-request ratios

2. **Team Collaboration**
   - Cross-team review patterns
   - Review bottlenecks

3. **PR Quality Indicators**
   - Large PRs (high risk)
   - PRs without reviews
   - Blocked PRs

4. **Developer Productivity**
   - PRs per person
   - Time from PR creation to merge
   - Draft PR usage patterns

5. **Traceability**
   - Jira Issue → Commit → PR (for merged PRs)
   - Which stories were delivered in which PRs
