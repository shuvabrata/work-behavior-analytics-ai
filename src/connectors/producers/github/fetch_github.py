"""Pure fetch functions for the GitHub connector.

All GitHub API I/O is isolated here. Functions return raw PyGithub objects or
plain lists so that callers (process_* orchestrators and handlers) are decoupled
from the API surface. Every call goes through ``retry_with_backoff`` for rate-limit
resilience.

Phase 3: These utilities replace inline API calls in the legacy ``process_*`` and
``new_*_handler`` modules. Phase 4 producers will import from this module to reuse
the same fetch logic without touching the database.

    # The call repo_obj.get_pulls (from PyGithub) does NOT support a date filter directly.
    # The get_pulls method only supports filtering by state, sort, direction, base branch, and head branch.
    # It does NOT accept updated_at or created_at filters.
    # See: https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github_objects/Repository.html#github.Repository.Repository.get_pulls
    #
    # WHY WE FETCH OPEN AND CLOSED PRs AS TWO SEPARATE CALLS (CRITICAL):
    #
    # We want to capture ALL pull requests — both open (mutable, still receiving
    # commits/reviews/labels) and closed/merged (terminal, immutable). However,
    # GitHub's /pulls endpoint does NOT return a single, globally
    # updated_at-sorted list when you pass state="all". Instead, it always
    # returns OPEN PRs FIRST, followed by CLOSED PRs, IRRESPECTIVE of the
    # `sort`/`direction` parameters. The sort only applies WITHIN each state
    # group.
    #
    # This matters because the caller (process_prs.py) relies on the returned
    # PRs being ordered newest-first by `updated_at` so it can `break` out of
    # its processing loop as soon as it hits a PR older than the sync cutoff
    # (an optimization that avoids paginating through the entire history).
    #
    # If we merely concatenated the two calls, the list would be:
    #   [open PRs sorted by updated desc] + [closed PRs sorted by updated desc]
    # The loop would encounter an OLD open PR (e.g. a long-lived PR last updated
    # months ago) and `break` early — silently skipping ALL newer closed PRs
    # that appear later in the list. That would be silent data loss.
    #
    # So we issue two separate calls — one for open, one for closed — each
    # independently sorted by updated desc, and then MERGE-SORT the combined
    # list globally by `updated_at` descending. This final global sort is what
    # guarantees the caller's early-break stays correct across both state
    # groups and no PRs are skipped.
