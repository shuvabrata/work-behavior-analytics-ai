    Retries rate-limit (HTTP 429) and transient network errors (DNS, connection
    reset/refused, timeout) until a total time budget (``retry_budget``) is
    exhausted. Backoff doubles each attempt, capped at ``backoff_cap`` seconds,

    dynamically via the runtime settings system without changing call sites.

    Args:
        func: Function to execute (should be a lambda or callable).
        retry_budget: Total retry budget in seconds. Defaults to the resolved
            ``RETRY_BUDGET_SECONDS`` (1 hour).
        backoff_cap: Maximum per-sleep delay in seconds. Defaults to the
            resolved ``RETRY_BACKOFF_CAP_SECONDS`` (30s).
