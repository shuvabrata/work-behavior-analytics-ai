"""Smoke tests for Dash layout callback registration.

Guards against accidental drops of Output declarations — a class of silent bug
where a callback is registered with Inputs but no Output, leaving the feature
broken with no runtime error and no exception raised at startup.

Pattern: Dash stores all registered callback outputs in ``app.callback_map``.
For single-output callbacks the key is ``"component_id.prop"``.  For
multi-output callbacks Dash serialises all outputs into one composite key
(format is internal and can change between Dash versions).  To stay resilient
across Dash upgrades every assertion uses ``_has_output`` which searches for
``"component_id.prop"`` as a *substring* of any registered key — meaning it
works regardless of how Dash formats multi-output keys.

How to use when a test fails
-----------------------------
1. The test docstring names the callback function and the feature it guards.
2. Find that function in ``src/app/dash_app/layout.py``.
3. Verify its ``@app.callback(...)`` decorator still contains the expected
   ``Output(...)`` argument — it was likely dropped during an edit or a
   string-replacement refactor.
4. Restore the missing ``Output`` line.

Each assertion in this file corresponds to a specific user-visible feature
that broke silently in production when its Output was accidentally removed.
