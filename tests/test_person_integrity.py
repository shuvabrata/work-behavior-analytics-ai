"""Integration tests for Person node data integrity in Neo4j.

These tests verify the two invariants that must hold after every sync run:
1. Every Person node is linked to at least one IdentityMapping via MAPS_TO.
2. Every Person email stored in Neo4j is lowercase.

Requires a live Neo4j instance.

Run with::
